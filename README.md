# portfolio-landing

Hi there welcome to my portfolio page. Here I present all the projects I have done so far mostly in Scrimba Front-End
Developer Career Path. Most of them ara Solo projects, which means I built them from scratch. Some of them are
modifications to learning project code. In such cases I totally personalized them and modified the logic.

In the first section you can find my latest projects in chronological order.

The second section has some featured apps.

This page per se has some interesting code. In particular check out carousel.js. It is a dynamic module to create
Bootstrap based carousel.
